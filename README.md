# Homelab Ansible Playbooks

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and roles I use to manage my NAS and several VMs üë®‚Äçüíª.

This project is designed for personal/familial scale maintenance, if you find this useful for your use, want to share advises or security concerns, feel free to drop me a line.

This is a good playground to learn and I encourage you to adapt these roles to your needs. While they might not be production-ready for all environments, I'm open to adapting them for [Ansible Galaxy]((https://galaxy.ansible.com)) if there's community interest!
